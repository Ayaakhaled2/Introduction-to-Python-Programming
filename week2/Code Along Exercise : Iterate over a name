prompt the user for their first name. 
Using a for loop, print each letter of the name on the same line, 
count each letter in the name, and then print the count of letters in the name. So let's get some user input.



code 
------------

first_name = input("please enter your first name .. ")
char_list = 0
for char in first_name :
    print(char , end = ' ')
    char_list += 1
print(char_list)
